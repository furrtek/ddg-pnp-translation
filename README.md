# ddg-pnp-translation
Densha de Go! Plug & Play English translation (WIP)

* [DONE] Extract texture-based text (in-game, menus)
* [WIP] Do the actual translation (see .txt's)
* [WIP] Make Photoshop files for each texture that needs to be translated (clean, add text)
* [TODO] Extract font-based text (tutorial)
* [TODO] Extract hi-res textures (warning screens)
* [TODO] Make a real compressing tool (current one just generates an ALLZ that does a big raw copy)
* [TODO] Make a proper install script

Big thanks to [@GMMan](https://www.github.com/GMMan) for sharing info on how to update game files.
